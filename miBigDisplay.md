# The miBigDisplay

This dash is designed to be used on a 4th monitor for information about a race, car and PC data.

The top part shows the map of the track on the left, the current standings on the right and the "pitstop-delta-time"(PDT) info in the middle.

To use the PDT-info, you first need to edit the miBigDisplay.js file and set your tested pitstop delta times at the beginning of the file.
